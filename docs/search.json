    "text": "Classic literature continues to captivate readers, even in the fast-paced, tech-driven world of today. Books like Jane Austen’s Pride and Prejudice and Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein have stood the test of time. But what makes these novels, written centuries ago, still resonate with modern readers? Using data from Project Gutenberg, I dive into the factors that sustain the popularity of classic literature in the digital age.\n\n\nThe key question behind this analysis is: Why do some classic novels remain popular even in the digital era? With free access to public domain works on platforms like Project Gutenberg, we can analyze download patterns to uncover the secrets behind the continued success of these works.\nThrough this analysis, I aim to understand the factors driving the sustained popularity of classic literature by exploring the relationship between readability and the number of downloads. Does accessibility in terms of readability contribute to the enduring appeal of these books?\n\n\n\nThe dataset for this analysis was sourced from Project Gutenberg, one of the largest collections of public domain works. The dataset includes over 1,000 classic novels with the following key variables:\n\nTitle: The name of each classic novel.\nNumber of Downloads: The total number of downloads for each book on Project Gutenberg.\nFlesch Reading Ease Score: A score indicating the readability of the text, where higher scores reflect easier readability.\n\n\n\nBefore diving into the analysis, I cleaned the dataset by removing books with missing download or readability data. Additionally, I filtered out non-classic works to focus solely on literature from the 19th century.

The graph below shows that, while there is a positive correlation between readability and downloads, it is not the only factor driving popularity.\n\n# Plot Readability vs Downloads\nggplot(cleaned_classics, aes(x = Readability, y = Downloads)) +\n  geom_point(color = \"blue\") +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", color = \"red\") +\n  labs(title = \"Readability vs. Downloads for Classic Novels\",\n       x = \"Flesch Reading Ease Score\",\n       y = \"Number of Downloads\")\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the graph above (Figure @ref(fig )), it is evident that more accessible books, like Pride and Prejudice, tend to have higher downloads. However, some lower-readability novels, like Frankenstein, maintain popularity due to their compelling narratives and cultural significance.\n\n\n\nAnother factor contributing to the popularity of classic novels is the diversity of genres they encompass. The chart below shows the breakdown of genres among the most downloaded classics, ranging from Gothic horror to social realism. Novels with universal themes like love, struggle, and social commentary attract readers from various walks of life.\n\n# Genre breakdown of top novels\ngenres &lt;- cleaned_classics %&gt;%\n  mutate(Genre = case_when(\n    str_detect(Title, \"Pride and Prejudice\") ~ \"Romance\",\n    str_detect(Title, \"Frankenstein\") ~ \"Gothic\",\n    str_detect(Title, \"Douglass\") ~ \"Slave Narrative\",\n    TRUE ~ \"Other\"\n  ))\n\nggplot(genres, aes(x = Genre, y = Downloads, fill = Genre)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n  labs(title = \"Most Downloaded Genres on Project Gutenberg\",\n       x = \"Genre\",\n       y = \"Number of Downloads\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe chart (Figure @ref(fig )) shows that genres like Gothic and Romance remain highly popular, proving that stories involving strong emotions and moral dilemmas continue to fascinate readers.\n\n\n\nClassic literature continues to thrive in the digital age, driven by both accessibility and timeless relevance. While readability plays a significant role in the popularity of these novels, other factors—such as thematic depth and genre diversity—are equally important. My analysis shows that novels with universal themes of love, justice, and morality continue to captivate readers across generations.\nAs noted by Flesch (1948), readability is essential for a text’s accessibility. However, the sustained success of works like Pride and Prejudice and Frankenstein highlights the importance of emotional resonance and narrative complexity. Through platforms like Project Gutenberg, these classics will remain a part of our cultural heritage for years to come.\n\n\n\nFlesch, R. (1948). A new readability yardstick.

I have always been drawn to the world of data, where the power of numbers and trends can unveil compelling stories and insights. My goal is to bridge the gap between data and meaningful, real-world applications, particularly in literature and business.\nWhen I’m not exploring data sets or diving deep into analysis, you’ll find me lost in a good book, brush in hand while painting, or immersing myself in various forms of creative arts. Reading has always been a passion of mine, particularly classic literature, which has taught me the importance of timeless themes and character-driven narratives.\nPainting is where I let my creativity flow, allowing me to balance the analytical rigor of data with artistic expression. My fascination with creative arts inspires me to view problems from multiple perspectives, a skill I apply both in life and in the field of business analytics.\nWith a unique blend of analytical skills and creative thinking, I strive to solve complex problems in innovative ways, ensuring that data-driven decisions not only make sense on paper but resonate with the human experience.\nGitHub"

However, some lower-readability novels, like Frankenstein, maintain popularity due to their compelling narratives and cultural significance.\n\n\n\nAnother factor contributing to the popularity of classic novels is the diversity of genres they encompass. The chart below shows the breakdown of genres among the most downloaded classics, ranging from Gothic horror to social realism. Novels with universal themes like love, struggle, and social commentary attract readers from various walks of life.\n\n# Genre breakdown of top novels\ngenres &lt;- cleaned_classics %&gt;%\n  mutate(Genre = case_when(\n    str_detect(Title, \"Pride and Prejudice\") ~ \"Romance\",\n    str_detect(Title, \"Frankenstein\") ~ \"Gothic\",\n    str_detect(Title, \"Douglass\") ~ \"Slave Narrative\",\n    TRUE ~ \"Other\"\n  ))\n\nggplot(genres, aes(x = Genre, y = Downloads, fill = Genre)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n  labs(title = \"Most Downloaded Genres on Project Gutenberg\",\n       x = \"Genre\",\n       y = \"Number of Downloads\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe chart (Figure @ref(fig )) shows that genres like Gothic and Romance remain highly popular, proving that stories involving strong emotions and moral dilemmas continue to fascinate readers.\n\n\n\nClassic literature continues to thrive in the digital age, driven by both accessibility and timeless relevance. While readability plays a significant role in the popularity of these novels, other factors—such as thematic depth and genre diversity—are equally important. My analysis shows that novels with universal themes of love, justice, and morality continue to captivate readers across generations.\nAs noted by Flesch (1948), readability is essential for a text’s accessibility. However, the sustained success of works like Pride and Prejudice and Frankenstein highlights the importance of emotional resonance and narrative complexity. Through platforms like Project Gutenberg, these classics will remain a part of our cultural heritage for years to come.\n\n\n\nFlesch, R. (1948). A new readability yardstick.
