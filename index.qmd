# About Me

![Photo of Dhanshree Dhrafani](My_photo.jpeg)

Hello, I'm Dhanshree Dhrafani, a Master’s student at Monash University, currently pursuing a Master's in Business Analytics. I have always been drawn to the world of data, where the power of numbers and trends can unveil compelling stories and insights. My goal is to bridge the gap between data and meaningful, real-world applications, particularly in literature and business.

When I'm not exploring data sets or diving deep into analysis, you'll find me lost in a good book, brush in hand while painting, or immersing myself in various forms of creative arts. Reading has always been a passion of mine, particularly classic literature, which has taught me the importance of timeless themes and character-driven narratives.

Painting is where I let my creativity flow, allowing me to balance the analytical rigor of data with artistic expression. My fascination with creative arts inspires me to view problems from multiple perspectives, a skill I apply both in life and in the field of business analytics.

With a unique blend of analytical skills and creative thinking, I strive to solve complex problems in innovative ways, ensuring that data-driven decisions not only make sense on paper but resonate with the human experience.
